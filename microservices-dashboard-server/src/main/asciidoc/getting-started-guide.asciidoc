use of HTTP verbs.

[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes

RESTful ordering-loyalty tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its
use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's
`Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

|===

[[overview-errors]]
== Errors

Whenever an error response (status code >= 400) is returned, the body will contain a JSON object
that describes the problem. The error object has the following fields:

include::{generated}/error-example/response-fields.adoc[]

For example, in case of unexpected backend error 
`500 Server Error` response will be returned:

include::{generated}/error-example/http-response.adoc[]

[[overview-hypermedia]]
== Hypermedia

RESTful customer-management uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources in their
responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application
Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should
not call URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate
from resource to resource.
